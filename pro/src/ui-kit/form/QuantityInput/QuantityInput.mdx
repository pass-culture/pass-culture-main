# QuantityInput

A QuantityInput component is a combinaison of a TextInput and a Checkbox to define **quantities**. This component should be used when undefined quantity is meant to be interpreted as unlimited.

## Using QuantityInput over TextInput

```jsx
<TextInput
  label="Quantity"
  type="number"
  value={quantity}
  onChange={setQuantity}
/>
```

If undefined quantity is meant to be interpreted as unlimited, the QuantityInput component should always be used.  
Otherwise, using TextInput is fine enough (mind min, max, and step props attributes).

## Extending props

The QuantityInput component picks a few props from the TextInput component, which itself sees its props extended from FieldLayoutBase and BaseInput.  
It's best to choose what needs to be picked than extending the props from the TextInput component so the QuantityInput component can be more flexible and easier to maintain.
