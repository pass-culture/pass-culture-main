# QuantityInput

A QuantityInput component is a combinaison of a TextInput and a Checkbox
to define **quantities**. This component should be used when undefined quantity
is meant to be interpreted as unlimited.

## Using QuantityInput over TextInput
  
```jsx
<TextInput
  label="Quantity"
  placeholder="IllimitÃ©"
  type="number"
  value={quantity}
  onChange={setQuantity}
/>
```

This lacks accessibility support.
Placeholders are generally something to avoid since they disappear when the input is focused,
or when the user starts typing.
They tend to be stylised with a lighter color, which can be hard to read for some users.
In this case, the placeholder was used to indicate that the quantity was unlimited,
which is not a placeholder's purpose.

If undefined quantity is meant to be interpreted as unlimited, the QuantityInput component should always be used.  
Otherwise, using TextInput is fine enough (mind min, max, and step props attributes).

## Extending props 

The QuantityInput component picks a few props from the TextInput component,
which itself sees its props extended from FieldLayoutBase and BaseInput.  
It's best to choose what needs to be picked than extending the props from the TextInput component
so the QuantityInput component can be more flexible and easier to maintain.
