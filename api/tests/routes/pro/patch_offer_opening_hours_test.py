"""Check that one client can create an offer's opening hours

This should only test some relatively basic behaviour:
    * all more complex opening hours creation tests should be done
    by the opening hours api test module
    * all the complex input validation tests should be done by the model
    test module

-> Check that every part seems to work together, there is no need to
go any further.
