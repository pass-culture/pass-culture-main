# Connection with a ticketing system

If you have a ticketing system to manage your events tickets, it is possible to connect your ticketing system with the pass Culture application.

## Mandatory set-up

To connect your ticketing system to the pass Culture application, you need first:

1. **To provide us with a booking and a cancelling URL** that we will request each time a beneficiary book/cancel a ticket for the event. You can find the process **[here](/docs/understanding-our-api/notification-system/setting-up-notifcations)**.
2. **To implement the notification authentication process** described **[here](/docs/understanding-our-api/notification-system/authenticating-our-notifications)** on your side.

## Enable ticket booking for an event

Once your provider account is properly set (with a booking URL and a cancellation URL), you can enable ticket booking for an event by **setting the `hasTicket` parameter to `true`** when **[creating the event](/rest-api#tag/Event-offers/operation/PostEventOffer)**.

:::note
Once the event is created, you cannot change the **`hasTicket`** attribute.
:::

## Ticket booking process 

### General explanation

If you enabled ticket booking for an event, we will call **your booking URL** whenever a beneficiary books a ticket for this event on the pass Culture application.
We will wait for your response, that must contain a barcode, and forward it to the beneficiary.

:::warning
As it is a **synchronous process**, we will display an error to the beneficiary :
- if **your response doesn't match the expected format**
- if **your server takes to long (more than ten seconds) to respond** to our request.
:::
