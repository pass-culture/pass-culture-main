# Managing countermarks

For **`Products`** (and **`Events`** not linked to a ticketing system), bookings are countermarks that you can validate or cancel by calling our API.

## Notification

### Prerequisites

To be notified when a beneficiary books (or cancels a booking) a product (or an event not linked to a ticketing system), you need :

- to have the notification URL set (**[as explained here](/docs/understanding-our-api/notification-system/setting-up-notifcations)**)
- to have implemented the pass Culture notification authentication on your side (**[as explained here](/docs/understanding-our-api/notification-system/authenticating-our-notifications)**) 

### Our request payload

Each time a beneficiary books a product (or an event not linked to a ticketing system) or cancels his/her booking, you will receive a post request on your **notification URL** with the following payload :

## Understanding booking statuses

### Booking statuses for `products`

- A booking has the status **`CONFIRMED`** when **a beneficiary has booked a product offer and has not yet retrieved his/her product**
- A booking has the status **`USED`** when **the booking has been validated by the cultural partner** (meaning the beneficiary has retrieved the product)
- A booking has the status **`REIMBURSED`** when **the pass Culture has reimbursed the cultural partner for the booking** (the beneficiary has retrieved the product and the pass Culture has reimbursed the cultural partner)
- A booking has the status **`CANCELLED`** when :
  - **the beneficiary has cancelled his/her booking**
  - **the cultural partner has cancelled the booking**
  - **the booking has automatically been cancelled** because the beneficiary has not retrieve his/her booking in time (10 days)

### Booking statuses lifecycle for `products`

#### Step 1 : booking creation with the status **`CONFIRMED`**
The beneficiary books a product. It creates a booking with the status **`CONFIRMED`**.

#### Step 2 : booking validation (`CONFIRMED` -> `USED`) or booking cancellation (`CONFIRMED` -> `CANCELLED`) 
Here there are four possibilities :
- **The beneficiary retrieves its booking** within 10 days, **so you validate its booking** : the booking status is set to **`USED`**
- **The beneficiary cancels its booking** : the booking status is set to **`CANCELLED`**
- **You cancel the beneficiary's booking** : the booking status is set to  **`CANCELLED`**
- **The pass Culture cancels the beneficiary's booking** because he/she does not retrieve its booking within 10 days : the booking status is set to  **`CANCELLED`**

#### Step 3 : booking reimbursement (`USED` -> `REIMBURSED`)
Every two weeks, the pass Culture reimbursed the used bookings. The booking status is then set to **`REIMBURSED`**.

### Booking statuses for `events`

- A booking has the status **`CONFIRMED`** when **a beneficiary has booked a ticket for your event**
- A booking has the status **`USED`** when :
  - **the ticket has been validated by you (at the event)**
  - **the ticket has been automatically validated by the pass Culture 48 hours after your event date** 
- A booking has the status **`REIMBURSED`** when **the pass Culture has reimbursed the cultural partner for the ticket**
- A booking has the status **`CANCELLED`** when :
  - **the beneficiary has cancelled his/her ticket**
  - **the cultural partner (you) has cancelled the ticket**

### Booking statuses lifecycle for `events`

#### Step 1 : booking creation with the status **`CONFIRMED`**
The beneficiary books a ticket for your event. It creates a booking with the status **`CONFIRMED`**.

#### Step 2 : booking validation (`CONFIRMED` -> `USED`) or booking cancellation (`CONFIRMED` -> `CANCELLED`) 

*Option 1 - Booking cancellation (**`CONFIRMED`** -> **`CANCELLED`**)*

A booking can be cancelled, i.e. its status set to **`CANCELLED`**, in three cases :
-  **by you**, until 48 hours before the event
-  **by the beneficiary** :
   -  **if the beneficiary booked its ticket more than two days before the event**, the beneficiary has the possibility to cancel its ticket **within the 48 hours following his/her booking** (otherwise, it is a last minute booking and it is not cancellable)
   -  **if you change your event date**, the beneficiary has the possibility to cancel its ticket :
      -  if your new event date is in **less** than two days, **until your event date**
      -  if your new event date is in **more** than two days, **within the 48 hours following your change**

*Option 2 - Booking validation (**`CONFIRMED`** -> **`USED`**)*

A booking is validated, i.e. its status set to **`USED`** :

- either **automatically by the pass Culture**, **48 hours after your event**
- either **by you**, at the event **[by calling the validation endpoint](#countermark-validation)**


#### Step 3 : booking reimbursement (`USED` -> `REIMBURSED`)
Every two weeks, the pass Culture reimbursed the used bookings. The booking status is then set to **`REIMBURSED`**.


## Countermark validation

To validate a countermark (i.e. a booking) presented by a beneficiary, **you need to do a PATCH request [on this URL](/rest-api#tag/Booking/operation/ValidateBookingByToken)**.

### âœ… Success 
If the countermark is found, and hasn't yet been used (i.e. if its status is **`CONFIRMED`**), then **we will return a `HTTP 204` response**, indicating that **the countermark has been successfully validated**. The countermark status will then change to **`USED`**.

### ðŸš« Errors 
You can expect **three kinds of errors** when trying to validate a countermark (i.e. a booking) on our servers.


#### `HTTP 403` : The booking has been reimbursed or is a cancellable event ticket

You will get an **`HTTP 403`** from our side if you try to validate a countermark (i.e. a booking):

- that has the status **`REIMBURSED`**, meaning it has already been used and you have been reimbursed for it by the pass Culture.
- **(in the case of event booking)** that can still be cancelled by the beneficiary ([**see above**](#booking-statuses-lifecycle-for-events))

#### `HTTP 404` : The booking has not been found

You will get an **`HTTP 404` response** from our side :

- if **the booking does not exist** on our side
- if you are trying to validate **a booking you are not allowed to access to**

#### `HTTP 410` : The booking has been cancelled or has already been used

You will get an **`HTTP 410`** from our side if you try to validate a countermark (i.e. a booking):

- that has the status **`USED`**, meaning it **has already been validated**
- that has the status **`CANCELLED`**, meaning that either you, the beneficiary or the pass Culture, **has cancelled the booking before it was used**


## Countermark cancellation

To cancel a countermark (i.e. a booking), **you need to do a PATCH request [on this URL](/rest-api#tag/Booking/operation/CancelBookingByToken)**.

### âœ… Success 
If the countermark is found, and hasn't yet been used (i.e. if its status is **`CONFIRMED`**), then **we will return a `HTTP 204` response**, indicating that **the countermark has been successfully cancelled**. The countermark status will then change to **`CANCELLED`**.

### ðŸš« Errors
You can expect **three kinds of errors** when trying to cancel a countermark (i.e. a booking) on our servers.


#### `HTTP 403` : The booking has been reimbursed or is a cancellable event ticket

You will get an **`HTTP 403`** from our side if you try to validate a countermark (i.e. a booking) that has the status **`REIMBURSED`**, meaning it has already been used and you have been reimbursed for it by the pass Culture.

#### `HTTP 404` : The booking has not been found

You will get an **`HTTP 404` response** from our side :

- if **the booking does not exist** on our side
- if you are trying to cancel **a booking you are not allowed to access to**

#### `HTTP 410` : The booking has been cancelled or has already been used

You will get an **`HTTP 410`** from our side if you try to cancel a countermark (i.e. a booking):

- that has the status **`USED`**, meaning it **has already been validated**
- that has the status **`CANCELLED`**, meaning that either you, the beneficiary or the pass Culture, **has cancelled the booking before it was used**
