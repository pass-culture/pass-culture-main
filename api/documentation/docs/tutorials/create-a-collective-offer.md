# Create a collective offer

## Setup

First, set up your provider if you haven't already done so (more information [**here**](/docs/mandatory-steps/request-a-provider-account#how-to-get-a-provider-account).

Next step is to ensure that your API key is linked to at least one venue.

:::warning
Note that in the integration test environment, all venues are linked to an Adage ID, which means you can create a collective offer for each of them. This is meant for simplifying the test of the collective offer creation functionality. 

However, in the production environment, it won’t be the case : **a venue is not automatically referenced in the Adage ecosystem**. Please ensure that the venues for which you are planning to create collective offers are linked to an Adage ID.

## API: create a bookable offer
