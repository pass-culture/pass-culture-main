# Create a test account

In order to test your integration before publishing it in production, we provide you with a test environment.
In this section, you will learn how to create an account on this test environment in **3 simple steps**.

:::warning
In the **test environment**, the account you are going to create will enable to log yourself as **a *cultural player* on the [PRO interface](https://integration.passculture.pro/connexion?de=%2F)** and to log yourself as **a *teenager user* on the [app interface](https://integration.passculture.app/accueil)**.
:::

1. **Create an account** as a cultural player on the [integration test environment](https://integration.passculture.pro/inscription)
