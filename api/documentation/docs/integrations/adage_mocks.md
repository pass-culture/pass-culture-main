# Adage mocks

It is possible to change the status of collective booking into the integration environment. We have created new endpoints to modify these statuses and simulate the booking timeline on the Adage side.

:::warning
Theses actions are not available from the **production** environment.
They are available from the **integration** one because Adage is not available from it.
