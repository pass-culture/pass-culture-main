# Change logs

:::warning
ðŸ’¡ Important notice concerning the **collective offers**.

The following changes will be applied during **early september 2025**.

- Offers location
  - The field `offerVenue` must not be used anymore. In order to locate a collective offer, you must now use the `location` attribute in the [**Create Collective Offer endpoint**](/rest-api#tag/Collective-Offers/operation/PostCollectiveOfferPublic) and the [**Update Collective Offer endpoint**](/rest-api#tag/Collective-Offers/operation/PatchCollectiveOfferPublic).
  - **You can find relevant information [here](/docs/understanding-our-api/resources/collective-offers#-offers-location).**
- Offers status
  - A new `offerStatus` has been added which will replace the current `status` field in the coming months. Both status fields are available for a period of time to allow the transition.
  - Note that the `status` field of the collective **booking** will not change.
  - Collective offers that are currently `isActive = false` and do not have a related booking will be archived. This does not apply to offers that are under review or rejected by the validation process.
  - **You can find details on the new status and the allowed actions [here](/docs/understanding-our-api/resources/collective-offers#collective-offer-status-and-allowed-actions).**
:::

:::info
Soon, a `bookingAllowedDatetime` param will be available at offer creation and update. Thanks to this new param, you will be able to precise when your offer becomes bookable. 

You will have two dates at your disposal :

- a `publicationDatetime` that indicates the date and time when the offer becomes visible in the beneficiary application
- a `bookingAllowedDatetime` that indicates the date and time when the offer becomes bookable in the beneficiary application. If not set, the offer will be bookable as soon as it is published.
