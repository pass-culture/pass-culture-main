# Change logs

:::warning
ðŸ’¡ Important notice some old resources are going to be removed in the coming months.

- If you were using `/v2/venue/<venue_id>/stocks` to manage stocks, you will have to migrate to this endpoint : [/public/offers/v1/products/ean](/rest-api#tag/Product-offer-bulk-operations/operation/PostProductOfferByEan). The endpoint `/v2/stock` will not be available anymore starting from September, the 31st 2024.
- If you were using `/v2/bookings` to manage bookings, you will have to migrate to those endpoints [/public/bookings/v1/bookings](/rest-api#tag/Bookings).  The endpoint `/v2/bookings` will not be available anymore starting from March, the 31st 2025.

**You can find a migration tutorial [here](/docs/tutorials/migrate-to-the-new-api).**

## June 2024

- You can now specify your own id when you [create an individual event offer](/rest-api#tag/Event-offers/operation/PostEventOffer) and/or [create stock for this event](/rest-api#tag/Event-offer-stocks/operation/PostEventStocks). This id is called `idAtProvider` and will be send to your ticketing system when a beneficiary books a ticket.

## January 2024

- Rate limiting has been implemented to the Pass Culture public API. **You are now limited to 200 requests/minute** per API key.
  Once this limit reached, you will received a `429 Too Many Requests` error message. You will then need to back down.
