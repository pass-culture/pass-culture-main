# Change logs

:::warning
💡 Important notice some old resources are going to be removed in the coming months.

- If you were using `/v2/bookings` to manage bookings, you will have to migrate to those endpoints [/public/bookings/v1/bookings](/rest-api#tag/Bookings).  The endpoint `/v2/bookings` will not be available anymore starting from June, the 30th 2025.

**You can find a migration tutorial [here](/docs/tutorials/migrate-to-the-new-api).**

:::warning
💡 Important notice concerning the **collective offers**.

- Offers location
  - The field `offerVenue` must not be used anymore. In order to locate a collective offer, you must now use the `location` attribute in the [**Create Collective Offer endpoint**](/rest-api#tag/Collective-Offers/operation/PostCollectiveOfferPublic) and the [**Update Collective Offer endpoint**](/rest-api#tag/Collective-Offers/operation/PatchCollectiveOfferPublic).
  - **You can find relevant information [here](/docs/understanding-our-api/resources/collective-offers#-offers-location).**
- Offers status
  - A new `offerStatus` has been added which will replace the current `status` field in the coming months. Both status fields are available for a period of time to allow the transition.
  - The new status will determine which actions are allowed on the collective offer (which fields can be updated, whether the booking can be cancelled...).
  - Note that the `status` field of the collective **booking** will not change.
  - The `isActive` and `isSoldOut` fields will be removed at the same time, as they are not relevant with the new status.
  - Collective offers that are currently `isActive = false` and do not have a related booking will be archived. This does not apply to offers that are under review or rejected by the validation process.
  - **You can find details on the new status and the allowed actions [here](/docs/understanding-our-api/resources/collective-offers#collective-offer-status-and-allowed-actions).**
