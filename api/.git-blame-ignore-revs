# Since version 2.23, git-blame has a feature to ignore or bypass
# certain commits.
#
# This file contains a list of commits that are not likely what you
# are looking for in a blame, such as mass reformatting or renaming.
# You can set this file as a default ignore file for blame by running
# the following command.
#
#     $ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# ... or by configuring it in your local or global Git configuration
# file:
#
#    [blame]
#    ignoreRevsFile = .git-blame-ignore-revs

# Introduction of the pcapi Python package: all code (except tests) is
# moved to a new src/pcapi directory, all internal import statements
# are updated, etc.
