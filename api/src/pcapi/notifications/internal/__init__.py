    """Send a message to pass Culture team's slack

    On dev: no message is sent, the payload is logged.
    The "Full payload:" printed on this log is meant to be paste straight to the Slack's Block-Kit-Builder for preview (https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder)

    On tests: the message is saved on the "requests" global object like all other outbound backends.
    This "requests" can be inspected to validate the backend was called.

    Args:
        channel: Slack's channel name as a string. Is typically different in EHP than in production.
        blocks: List of message blocks. Possible format can be found on the slack's documentation (https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks)
        icon_emoji: emoji name as a string, for exemple ":rubber-duck:". Can be used to easily identify the origin of the message. Beware that messages from the same bot are sometimes aggregated in a way that a chage of emoji is not visible.
