This directory holds the betamax test cassettes that are pre-generated
for unit testing. This can be removed in the future with a functional
test that stands up a full devstack, records a cassette and then
replays it as part of the test suite.

Until the functional testing is implemented do not remove this
directory or enclosed files.
