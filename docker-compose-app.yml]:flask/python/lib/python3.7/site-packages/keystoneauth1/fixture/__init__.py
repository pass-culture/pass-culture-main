"""
Produce keystone compliant structures for use in testing.

They are part of the public API because they may be relied upon to generate
test tokens for other clients. However they should never be imported into the
main client (keystoneauth or other). Because of this there may be dependencies
from this module on libraries that are only available in testing.
