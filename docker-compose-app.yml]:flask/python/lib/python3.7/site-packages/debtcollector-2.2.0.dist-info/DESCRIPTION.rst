    :alt: Latest Version

A collection of Python deprecation patterns and strategies that help you
collect your technical debt in a non-destructive manner. The goal of this
library is to provide well documented developer facing deprecation
patterns that start of with a basic set and can expand into a larger
set of patterns as time goes on. The desired output of these patterns
is to apply the warnings module to emit DeprecationWarning or PendingDeprecationWarning
or similar derivative to developers using libraries (or potentially
applications) about future deprecations.
