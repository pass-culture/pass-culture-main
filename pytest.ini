# FIXME (dbaty, 2020-10-21): we should remove prefixes such as Get,
# Post, Patch, etc. because pytest complains, for example:
#     PytestCollectionWarning: cannot collect test class 'GetVenueLabels'
#     because it has a __init__ constructor
#
# ... even though the mentioned class is not in the tests (but is
# imported by tests).
# As far as I can tell, these prefixes are only used in tests of
# routes, where they could be removed because the test filename
# already contains the HTTP verb...
